# Provenance-Threads

Inspired by XKCD's storyline plots of Lord of the Rings, Jurassic Park, and Primer, I'm excited to try out a new art project:
tracing the history of several artworks before they arrived in the MoMA collection.

# Progress

* Download artwork provenance information from special pages on MoMA.org
* Structure data in MongoDB
* Draw random timeline

--> I am here <--

* Parse place notes to get dates
* Draw logical timeline
* Find commonalities in location

# Components

* D3.js by Mike Bostock
* <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/master/sankey">Sankey plugin</a> for D3
