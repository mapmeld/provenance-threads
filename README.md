# Provenance-Threads

Inspired by XKCD's storyline plots of Lord of the Rings, Jurassic Park, and Primer, I'm excited to try out a new art project:
tracing the history of several artworks before they arrived in the MoMA collection.

# Progress

* Download artwork provenance information from special pages on MoMA.org
* Structure data in MongoDB

--> I am here <--

* Parse place notes to get dates
* Draw timeline
* Find commonalities in location
